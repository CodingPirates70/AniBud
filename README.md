# **ANIBUD**:- A Unique Solution For Wildlife

ANIBUD stands for Animal Buddy… is an **Flutter App** dedicated to create an environment for preservation and protection of wildlife. We believe that all animals have the right to live and thrive in their natural habitats, free from harm and exploitation.

Our mission is to work towards the conservation of **endangered species**, the **protection of wildlife habitats**, and the promotion of sustainable practices that benefit both animals and humans.

Through our efforts, we hope to raise awareness about the importance of **wildlife conservation** and inspire people to take action to protect the natural world around us.

Join us in our mission to preserve and protect the incredible diversity of life on our planet. Together, we can make a difference.

# How It Works?

Our App Is Basically designed in such a way that it can **Save life of Innocent Animals**… and We are happy to do so.

It works on Real-life problems and provides Instant Response To The Reported query, and has User-Friendly Interface.

Coming to the Working part of it, so Basically we have used **Flutter** And **Figma** to Design our Frontend UI part of App and for the Backend Part we have used Various **API’s(Application Programming Interface)**, created **Databases** To Store The Information Of User And to ease the Communication between the User And The Respondents and we have also made An **UPI(Unified Payments Interface)** App which we will be using For **Donation purpose**, we used **Auth0** For storing User Id and Storing the Password Securely and we had also Implemented Some Complex Logic Building In our project.

# Features:-

Here, Our Interface Is Mainly Divided into Four Parts➖

- **VET HOSPITALS NEAR YOU:-** As the Name Suggests, We have implemented Google Map API in such a way that, suppose in a Case of Any Road Accident, an animal gets injured then our App Locates The User’s Current Location(Dynamic location), and **Direct the User’s Location to Nearby Hospital’s** when Reported By the User. In Case Of confirmation from the Hospital Side,  an **Auto-Generated Mail** which will be Directing The Confirmation Mail To User… and Later on the Injured Animal Will Be Picked up by the Hospital Staffs around that area.
    
    We have also added Two Sub-parts in it :-
    
    1. **For Personal Pets :-** They are the Most loved one’s, so for your loving one we have implemented the Map API which locates the nearby Vet hospitals near you within a fixed Area and You can use our **Direction’s To Navigate** to the place whenever your pet needs any medical help.
    2. **For Injured Animal** :- In Roads or Highways, we often see animals Badly Injured by **Road Accident**, So for It the user can report the injured animal from our app which will direct to the nearby hospital with the location of the user and an automated message will be send to the user , later the animal will be rescued by the responsible hospital.
- **Report Any ILLEGAL Activity** :- We deployed a system where a person can interact with our App, in which he can report any ILLEGAL Activities, we will track his location(user) and redirect an mail to the nearest **Police Station** so that the police can take action quickly. If **Fake report** are observed from the user, we will ban the user after three trials.
- **Find Your Lost Pets** :- We developed a system where a user can upload an image of his/her lost pet image and we will try to match with the image uploaded by another user, if he sees any lost pet by location sorting
- **Donation** :- We have implemented our own UPI system which helps in ease of transfer of Money and It’s Specially Designed For those people who are Animal Lover’s and want to donate some money for NGO’S who focuses on treatment of Street Animals or they can help getting them foods with that money.

# **Future Aspects** :-

According to Us, We have Implemented The Best Possible Ways to Enhance Our Project in 36 hours… In Future, we want to Improve the UI interface and make it more Attractive, We want to implement better API’s for reducing the latency time, we want the inbuilt Map to Show the hospitals Across the Entire Map(excluding of specific locations) and also want to add AI(Artificial Intelligence) here which will make this app more liable in future. If anybody wants to Contribute too We are open to it.

# Our Learnings :-

We had an Very Exciting Experience Fortunately it was our 1st Hackathon, Took many learnings through it- how to make proper strategy, how to Build as a Team, how to be Patience, How to be Proactive, How to deal with intense Situation, time management and many more…initially we faced huge problems in implementing various features in our App but the Teams Never Give Up Attitude made us reach to the completion of this project., while doing the project we came to know that we don’t have enough resource to track animal trafficking or to prevent abusing of endangered species so we tried to get to this app. We are sure it will help our community.
